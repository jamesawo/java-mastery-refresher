## Java Variable Naming Conventions

It is important to name variables accurately and clearly, so that the code is easier to read and understand. In most cases, following the standard naming conventions when naming variables in Java leads to better code readability and improves the efficiency of debugging and maintenance.

2. Avoid using single letter variables
3. Use meaningful words to name variables
4. Avoid same name or slightly similar names for multiple variables, it may cause confusion later.
5. Follow existing naming conventions in the codebase
