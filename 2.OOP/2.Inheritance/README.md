# Inheritance in Java

In this section, we will learn about Java inheritance and its types with the help of some examples.

## What is Inheritance in Java?

Inheritance is one of the key features of OOP that allows us to create a new class from an existing class.

Inheritance allows classes to inherit attributes and methods of other classes. This means that parent classes extend attributes and behaviors to child classes. Inheritance supports reusability.

We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:

-   subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class.
-   superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from.

To inherit from a class, we use the `extends` keyword.
