# Encapsulation in Java

Encapsulation is how state and behavior are wrapped together under a single unit. In simple terms, it is more or less like a protective shield that prevents the states from being accessed by the code outside.

## Why encapsulation?

In Java, encapsulation helps us to keep related fields and methods together, which makes our code cleaner and easy to read.

It helps to control the values of our data fields.

## Need for Encapsulation in Java

Encapsulation improvises the procedure of coding to a whole new level. We need encapsulation in Java for various reasons. Some are stated below:

-   Better Control: Encapsulation provides ultimate control over the data members and data methods inside the class.

-   Getter and Setter: The standard IDEs provide in-built support for ‘Getter and Setter’ methods, which increases the programming pace.

-   Security: Encapsulation prevents access to data members and data methods by any external classes. The encapsulation process improves the security of the encapsulated data.

-   Flexibility: Changes made to one part of the code can be successfully implemented without affecting any other part of the code.

## Data Hiding in Java

Data hiding is a procedure done to avoid access to the data members and data methods and their logical implementation. Data hiding can be done by using the access specifiers. We have four access specifiers, which are as follows.

-   Default
-   Public
-   Private
-   Protected
