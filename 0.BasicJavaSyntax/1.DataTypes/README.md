# Data Types in Java

A variable in Java must be a specified data type. Java is statically-typed, so it expects its variables to be declared before they can be assigned values.

## Data types are divided into two groups:

1. Primitive data types includes

    - byte
    - short
    - int
    - long
    - float
    - double
    - boolean
    - char

2. Non-primitive data types -
    - String
    - Arrays
    - Classes
