# Expressions, Statements and Blocks

This section aims to cover briefly Java expressions, statements and blocks.

In Java, an expression is a line of code that holds some information. An expression becomes a statement when it then carries out an action on that information or variable. A block of code holds any number of statements that you need to keep together. Blocks can be nested, that is blocks-within-blocks.

## Expressions

An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value.

## Statements

Statements are roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages. A statement forms a complete unit of execution. The following types of expressions can be made into a statement by terminating the expression with a semicolon.

-   Assignment expressions
-   Any use of ++ or --
-   Method invocations
-   Object creation expressions

Such statements are called expression statements. Here are some examples of expression statements

```java
// assignment statement
aValue = 8933.234;

// increment statement
aValue++;

// method invocation statement
System.out.println("Hello World!");

// object creation statement
Bicycle myBike = new Bicycle();
```

## Blocks

A block is a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed.
