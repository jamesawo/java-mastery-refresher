# Java Mastery Refresher

Welcome to the Java Mastery Refresher repository! This is a collection of topics, concepts, code snippets and projects designed to help you refresh your knowledge of Java and improve your proficiency with the language.
As software engineers, it's common to forget certain concepts and topics as we move on to new projects and technologies. That's why I created the Java Mastery Refresher repository - to serve as a refresher for Java developers who need to quickly brush up.
