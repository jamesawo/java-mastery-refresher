# Classes and Object in Java

This section aims to help refresh on the concept of classes and object in Java programming.

## What is a class?

In your applications, you will often find many individual objects of the some kind.Each object was built from a set of blueprints and therefore contains some components.
A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.

## What is an Object?

An object is an entity in the real world that can be distinctly identified. Objects have states and behaviors. In other words, they consist of methods and properties to make a particular type of data useful.

An object consists of:

-   **A unique identity:** Each object has a unique identity, even if the state is identical to that of another object.
-   **State/Properties/Attributes:** State tells us how the object looks or what properties it has.
-   **Behavior:** Behavior tells us what the object does.

### Examples of object states and behaviors in Java:

Let's look at some real-life examples of the states and behaviors that objects can have.

#### Example 1:

-   Object: Car.
-   State: color, brand, weight, model.
-   Behavior: break, accelerate, turn, change gears.

#### Example 2:

-   Object: House.
-   State: address, color, location.
-   Behavior: open door, close door, open blinds.
