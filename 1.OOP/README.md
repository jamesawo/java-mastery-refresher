# Object-Oriented Programming in Java

This section aim to help us refresh or learn about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java programming.

## Description

Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it is designed around the concept of objects. Objects are instances of classes, which define the properties and behaviors of the object.

## What is covered?

In this section, you will refresh on the four key concepts of OOP:

-   Encapsulation: The practice of hiding the implementation details of a class from the outside world, and exposing only the necessary interfaces for interacting with the class.
-   Inheritance: The ability to create new classes based on existing classes, inheriting their properties and behaviors.
-   Polymorphism: The ability of an object to take on many forms.
-   Abstraction: The practice of focusing on the essential features of an object, while hiding unnecessary details.

You will also learn about other important OOP concepts, such as constructors, methods, access modifiers, and interfaces.

## Section Structure

This section is organized into several directories, each focusing on a different aspect of OOP in Java:

-   Encapsulation
-   Inheritance:
-   Polymorphism:
-   Abstraction:
-   Advanced OOP Concepts:
    -   such as nested classes,
    -   generics, and enums.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this section, you should have a basic understanding of Java programming. You should be familiar with variables, data types, control structures, and basic syntax.

Go to [0.BasicJavaSyntax](https://github.com/jamesawo/java-mastery-refresher/tree/main/0.BasicJavaSyntax) Section to refresh on the basics.

## Conclusion

Object-Oriented Programming is an essential concept in Java programming (and other programming language too). By mastering the key concepts of OOP, you can write more efficient, organized, and maintainable code.
